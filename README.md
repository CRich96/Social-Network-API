# Social-Network-API


## The Challenge:

The challenge was to build a RESTful API that allows a social media startup to perform CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions data models using a NoSQL database. The API must be built using Node.js and Mongoose and must provide endpoints that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

API must allow users to:

- Create and delete user accounts.
- Create, read, update, and delete thoughts.
- Add and remove reactions to thoughts.
- Add and remove friends to a user's friend list.

Test API: use Insomnia or a similar tool to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints and verify that the responses are correct.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## What I Learned:
1. Built a RESTful API with Node.js and Mongoose.
2. Used NoSQL database to handle unstructured data.
3. Created endpoints for CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions data models.
4. Implemented endpoints to add and remove friends from a user's friend list.
5. Tested API endpoints using Insomnia.
6. Worked with HTTP requests and JSON formatted data.
7. Utilized environment variables and .env files for sensitive data.
